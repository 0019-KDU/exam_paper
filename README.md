# Quadratic Equation Solver (Java)

This is a simple Java program that allows users to input the coefficients 'a', 'b', and 'c' of a quadratic equation (ax^2 + bx + c = 0) and then calculates and displays the roots of the equation.

## How to Use

1. Make sure you have Java installed on your computer.

2. Clone this repository or download the `QuadraticEquationSolver.java` file.

3. Open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to the folder containing the `QuadraticEquationSolver.java` file.

4. Compile the program using the command: `javac QuadraticEquationSolver.java`

5. Run the program using the command: `java QuadraticEquationSolver`

6. Follow the on-screen instructions to input the coefficients 'a', 'b', and 'c' of the quadratic equation.

7. The program will then calculate the roots of the equation and display the results.

## Special Cases Handled

- If the coefficient 'a' is 0, the program treats the equation as a linear equation (bx + c = 0) and calculates the root accordingly.

- If 'a', 'b', and 'c' are all 0, it represents an identity equation (0x^2 + 0x + 0 = 0). In this case, the program informs the user that all real numbers are solutions.

## Precision

The roots are rounded to two decimal places for better readability.
